#+TITLE: Dotfiles Repository
#+AUTHOR: Alexander Neville

* Introduction

This repository is for storing some configuration files I have for all sorts of software. The layout of this repository does not reflect the layout of my home directory, I just use this repository for storage of certain important files. Some of these files are written from scratch, some are automatically generated and some are more or less default configurations. I keep these files even if they are fairly generic as I will not have to go and find defualt configurations elsewhere.

* Configurations

These are the configuration files which I have:

** Emacs

I have a configuration for vanilla emacs, including a 'literate' org file and i also have a configuration for doom emacs, a very good configuration framework which you can find here:  https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs
I would really reccomend doom emacs, simply because it is very well optimized and I find it much more performant than a vanilla configuration.

** Window Managers

I have configured a few X window managers a little bit, including: xmonad, qtile and awesome. I also have a dwm 'configuration' in another repository.

** Vim/Neovim

I followed some tutorials on the internet to create a Neovim configuration including CoC completion: https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim

** Shell

I use a few aliases in shell which i keep in =aliasrc=. These are sourced in both my bash and zsh config. 

** Apache

It can save time to keep this configured httpd (apache) config for arch linux

** Misc

Other files include things like =.xinitrc= and =.Xresources=, not very exciting.
