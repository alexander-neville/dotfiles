#+TITLE: My WM configuration



These are my key bindings for Xmonad, inspired by vi keys.

A /"M"/ represents the windows or super key. /"M1"/ is the /alt/ key. /"S"/ is the shift key and /"C"/ is the control key. If two or more keys are joined by a "-" that means they must be held at the same time. If there is a space between letters, it is  a keychord and the keys should be released and the next one pressed.


* Regular Keybindings

*M-q* reload xmonad if you change the config file
*M-S-q* exit xmonad

*M-p* dmenu or other run prompt
*M-<Return>* terminal (alacritty in my case)
*M-r* show/hide a terminal scratchpad on any workspace

*M-[1,... x]* use the number keys to switch to corresponding workspace
*M-<Down>* switch to workspace below/to the right
*M-<Right>* switch to workspace below/to the right
*M-<Left>* switch to workspace above/to the left
*M-<Up>* switch to workspace above/to the left

*M-S-[1,..x]* move current window to corresponding workspace
*M-S-<Down>* move current window downward/to the right
*M-S-<Right>* move current window downward/to the right
*M-S-<Up>* move current window upward/to the left
*M-S-<Left>* move current window upward/to the left

*M-j* shift focus downward (this cycles around clockwise)
*M-k* shift focus upward (this cycles around anti-clockwise)
*M-l* same as /M-k/, used to make WM behave like vim
*M-h* return focus to the master pane on the left
*M-m* return focus to the master pane on the left

*M-S-j* swap the current window with the one below
*M-S-k* swap the current window with the one above
*M-S-m* swap the current window with the master window

*M-C-j* combine with window below into tabs
*M-C-k* combine with window above into tabs
*M-.* cycle forward through tabs
*M-,* cycle backward through tabs
*M-C-/* unmerge all tabs

*M-c* close window with focus
*M-S-c* close all windows in workspace

*M-n* toggle borders around windows
*M-<Space>* completely full screen the current window or exit fullscreen mode
*M-S-<Space>* cycle through layouts
*M-b* kill the bar if it is annoying you (/M-q/ will bring it back)

* Using the Mouse

At any time, hover the mouse over a window to change focus to it. With the command/windows/super/meta key held down drag the window with the left mouse pressed down to float it. Use the right mouse button down to drag the window into the right proportions.

At any time press *M-t* to send the window back into the tiling mode. If there are many floating windows, press *M-S-t* to send them all back to tiling.
